        <h1>Welcome to the EasyBib Demo Client! <small>Discover our hypermedia API</small></h1>
    </div>

    <p>
        This client was created to demonstrate how to access EasyBibs hypermedia api using the <a
                href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1">OAuth2 Authorization Code Grant.</a>
        OAuth2 is not simple to grasp in the beginning so we will guide you through the first steps.
    </p>
    <p>For getting a working client you need three things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A <strong>redirectUrl</strong> The redirect URL is the callback URL that EasyBib will return the the user to after successful authentication.</li>
        <li>A <strong>clientID</strong> and a <strong>clientSecret</strong> which you will get when you register your first application on <a
                    href="https://data.easybib.com/application/">https://data.easybib.com/application/</a> where you need to enter your <strong>redirectUrl</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>This is your client application!</h3>
    <p>
        So we can say you registered at EasyBib, registered a client application and this application you are seeing here is your application. Now you want users of your site to allow your application to access their data on EasyBib for them for a usecase.
    </p>
    <h3>Which scope do you need the user to accept?</h3>
    <p>
        To start, we created some scopes to restrict access to the resources.
    </p>
    {% for scope, description in scopes %}
    <h4>{{ scope }} <small>{{ description }}</small></h4>
    <p>
        <div class="well well-sm">
            Try accessing data with the {{ scope }} scope: <a href="http://data.easybib.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id={{ clientId }}&scope={{ scope }}">
                http://data.easybib.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=clientId&scope={{ scope }}
            </a>
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
